# Quartz TWW S1

This is the source for the content at https://maggiesuewow.github.io/QuartzTWWS1/.

This is a very simple static site built with Hugo and a simple theme. 
The plots in [static](https://github.com/MaggieSueWoW/QuartzTWWS1/blob/master/static/) are generated by separate
Python scripts which I'll place in another repo sometime soon.

# Requirements

* Hugo v0.140.0+extended or higher
* [Hugo Ananke Theme](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke)
